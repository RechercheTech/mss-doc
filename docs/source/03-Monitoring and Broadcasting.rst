Monitoring and Broadcasting
===========================

Epoptes
-------
Epoptes is a monitoring and broadcasting tool to assist teachers in imparting lessons.

Only a user belonging to “epoptes” group can launch epoptes application, see :ref:`add-user-to-epoptes-group`.

All pre-configured teacher accounts are already members of the *epoptes* group. Using epoptes is self evident and intuitive, however complete documentation is available `here <https://translate.google.com/translate?u=http://ts.sch.gr/wiki/Linux/epoptes>`__.

When using ``English-Desktop``, a teacher can start Epoptes as below:

  Alt+F2 -> ltsp-remoteapps epoptes
